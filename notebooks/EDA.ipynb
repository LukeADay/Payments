    "Exploratory data analysis is a necessary step to understand the structure of the data, run checks for data issues, produce one and two way analysis to develop hypotheses and inform both feature engineering feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question for the analysis is ambiguous - 'use the data set provided to answer questions such as \"how likely is a payment to be successful\"'. This could be for a payment that has only just been created, or one that has initiated, or even one that has made it to the authorisation stage. Of course if it makes it to being authorised far it will be highly likely to execute. Dataset also includes colummns that will result in clear leakage - e.g `failure_reason` and `executed_at` - these should not be included as predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could restrict the data to those that have either succeeded or failed, and build a model to **understand** what is driving the probability of failure. Alternatively we could develop it as a predictive model to predict the probability for a given payment, but we won't necessarily have e.g 'time of authorisation' or even 'initiation'. We could say given that they have made it to this point. In that case feature engineering could look like follows:\n",
    "* Time-to-event as a feature (lastupdate - createddate) for success/failures.\n",
    "* Initiation time (initiation date - createdate): this will missing if it didn't make it to this stage.\n",
    "* Authorisation time (authorized date - authorising date) - noting some people won't make it this far impliying failure\n",
    "* Were they initiated? (intiation date is missing or not) - same as above\n",
    "* Were they authorised? (authorisation is missing or not) - same as above\n",
    "- Everyone that settles executes, so using this as a feature results in leakage - do not include as predictor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall goal of the analysis (not in this notebook) is to build a predictive model to predict whether a payment is successful (`executed`) or not. Before jumping into building a model the following should be assessed / inspected:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Missing values: need to be dealt with appropriately, or they can bias the analysis - particularly if they are not missing at random.\n",
    "* Feature imbalance: a factor with a category with only a handful of observations is unlikely to \n",
    "* Target imbalance: if the outcome is not close to an even split, different evaluation metrics will be required compared to accuracy/ AUC ROC.\n",
    "* Univariate associations: which features are associated with the outcome, not adjusting for confounding variables\n",
    "* Feature engineering: what features can we combine to create new features that are predictive of the outcome\n",
    "* Multicollinearity: highly correlated variables can cause estimation issues, high variance and complicate interpretation. If two variables are perfectly correlated one should be dropped, as it won't offer any more information but will cost degrees of freedom."
